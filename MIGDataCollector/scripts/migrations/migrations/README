   1.1 BASIC STEPS TO EXECUTE THE SQL SCRIPTS IN THE DB ENVIRONMENT: (Applicable for both QA and Developer)
       =============================================================

        Steps Applicable for both Windows and Linux:
        --------------------------------------------

        INSTALLATION OF LIBRARIES:
        =========================

        Step1: Open cmd or Terminal.

        Step2: Goto your gitcloned MIGateway project directory like below path example
               C:\Project\MIGateway\MIGDataCollector

        Step3: Execute the below command.

	           COMMAND                                         DESCRIPTION OF COMMAND TO UNDERSTAND

	    pip install -r requirements.txt  | This command execute libraries to execute the sql scripts.


	    Step4: Change the credentials of your mysql server USER,PASSWORD and DATABASE in config.py file .
	           The file is placed under config folder from gitcloned MIGateway project directory
	           E.G MIGateway\MIGDataCollector\config\config.py

	     DATABASE in MYSQL SERVER:
	     ========================

        Step5: check the database miggateway is created in the mysql server. If not please create it in the server.
               By using the below script command to create database in the mysql server.

               CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `miggatewaydb` /*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 */;


         SET PROJECT PATH:
         =================
         Step6: set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;gitclone project MIGateway directory\MIGDataCollector

         E.g: set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\project\MIGateway\MIGDataCollector


         Step7: Execute the below command.
                open cmd or Terminal
                Got to the path  gitcloned MIGateway project directory using command cd.
                E.G MIGateway\MIGDataCollector\scripts\migrations

               COMMAND                               DESCRIPTION OF COMMAND TO UNDERSTAND

         python manage.py version_control | This command checks for database given in config.py file it is not
                                             exist it throws Unknown database error then create the database and
                                             run the command it set the default version is 0 for the database.


          UPGRADE-Execute the scripts to create,alter,insert,update:
          =======
              It executes the created sql scripts in the gitcloned MIGateway project directory under MIGDataCollector under scripts
          under migrations under migrations under versions folder.

            Below is the example for the path.

                 E.G: MIGateway\MIGDataCollector\scripts\migrations\migrations\versions


           Step1: In the cmd or Terminal
                  Goto gitcloned MIGateway project directory\MIGDataCollector\scripts\migrations

           Step2: Execute the below command

                    COMMAND                            DESCRIPTION OF COMMAND TO UNDERSTAND


            python manage.py upgrade         | This command executes the sql scripts in the Database(miggatewaydb).



          DOWNGRADE-Revert back the executed scripts in the mysql server miggatewaydb database:
          =========

           Step1: In the cmd or Terminal
                  Goto gitclone MIGateway project directory\MIGDataCollector\scripts\migrations

           Step2: Execute the below command

                    COMMAND                                                 DESCRIPTION OF COMMAND TO UNDERSTAND
            python manage.py downgrade <version number>            | If want to downgrade sql scripts under the version number E.g (1->0)
                                                                     execute the commands.


     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   1.2 CREATING A NEW SQL SCRIPTS (Applicable for Developers only)
       ===========================

        To create a new sql scripts to execute in the mysql server. Before adding scripts make sure 1.1 upto upgrade is done.

        Step1: Open cmd or Terminal
               Goto gitcloned MIGateway project directory\MIGDataCollector\scripts\migrations
               E.g: MIGateway\MIGDataCollector\scripts\migrations

        Step2: Execute the below command

	           COMMAND                                                                          DESCRIPTION OF COMMAND TO UNDERSTAND

	  python manage.py script_sql mysql "description of script"                      | This command create the upgrade and downgrade script in the script
                                                                                     folder under gitcloned MIGateway project directory\MIGDataCollector\scripts\migrations\migrations\versions folder
                                                                                     in the format of ascending order in version number and description.
                                                                                     E.g: <version>-<description>_<mysql>_upgrade.sql and <version>-<description>_<mysql>_downgrade.sql


        Step3: Add your create or insert or update or etc sql scripts in the <version>-<description>_<mysql>_upgrade.sql under gitcloned MIGateway project directory\MIGDataCollector\scripts\migrations\migrations\versions folder

        Step4: Add your revert back sql scripts that is drop or etc in the <version>-<description>_<mysql>_downgrade.sql under gitcloned MIGateway project directory\MIGDataCollector\scripts\migrations\migrations\versions folder

        Step5: Do above 1.1 Upgrade to execute the new script in the mysql server miggateway database.
